# Blindness-Detection

Here is a link to my blog post regarding the same:

The dataset I have worked on is a part of an online Kaggle competition- APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection.
The goal of this competition is to detect blindness before it happens, organized by APTOS, data taken from Aravind Eye Hospitals here, in my home country India. In this synchronous Kernels-only competition, you’ll build a machine learning model to speed up disease detection. You’ll work with thousands of images collected in rural areas to help identify diabetic retinopathy automatically. If successful, you will not only help to prevent lifelong blindness, but these models may be used to detect other sorts of diseases in the future, like glaucoma and macular degeneration.This blog post is meant to provide a good starting point and insights for those who use PyTorch for training and fine-tuning your models.
